# Graduate-Admissions-Predictions

Project Description:

We are analysing the dataset Graduate Admission Predictions. We are also implementing various Mcahine Learning concepts as a part ofour research
Many factors are considered by the universities when provding an admit for a student. This predictive analysis focuses on importance ofeach attribute to accurately determine if the student will get an admit. We have also compared vaious algorithms to see which fits in bestfor the dataset.

Dataset:

This dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions.

Content:

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parametersincluded are :
GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ) University Rating ( out of 5 ) Statement of Purpose and Letter ofRecommendation Strength ( out of 5 ) Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ) Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ) Chance of Admit ( rangingfrom 0 to 1 ) is the Target Variable

Models:

We have built various Macgine Learning models to predict the chance of admits
Logistic Regression
Extra Tree Regressor
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
